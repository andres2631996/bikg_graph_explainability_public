To open a Pull Request (PR), go to Pull requests label on top of the repository

To run tests:

```

If any new features are added, please write a PR with it, including commits with clear and concise messages. 
If the changes are very large, please include commits with a paragraph description, so that:

```
$ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
> 
> A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."
```

Make sure that all PRs come from new separated branches
